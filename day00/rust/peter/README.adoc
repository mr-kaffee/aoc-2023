== Day 00: Hello World

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] *Hello World*, https://adventofcode.com/2023/[AoC|2023] starts.

It will be another year of Rust solutions for me. It is just so much fun, that I am not tempted to try another language.

I will again try to not use any external dependencies and create fast solutions.


=== General solution structure 

The general structure of my solutions will be as follows:

```
+- src
|  +- lib.rs    // the actual implementation
|  +- main.rs   // the code to run the solution
+- Cargo.toml   // cargo manifest
+- README.adoc  // documentation of the solution
```

The solution is run using `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`. Sometimes there will be features for solution variants, that will be run with `cargo run --features [some feature] --release`.

Typically, there will also be tests which can be executed using `cargo test` or `cargo test --release`


=== Hello World implementation

The implementation will typically consist of the parts detailed below.

Some meta and type information:
[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=prelude]
----

Some code to parse the input (in this example, this also includes a simple `doctest`):
[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]
----

The implementation of the solution functions `star_1` (and for most days `star_2`):
[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=star_1]
----


=== Hello World tests
