== Rust | Day 4: Scratchcards

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4[AoC|2023|4].

=== Input

Today, I directly operate on the input as `&str`, no pre-processing.

=== Star 1

I build an iterator which yields for every line the number of items that appear in both lists on the scratch card using a hash set. Then I apply the scoring function to those numbers and take the sum:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=star_1]
----

=== Star 2

I pass through all cards once to update the number of subsequent cards. Since the outer fold does not know the total number of cards, I need to initialize enough counters with `1` (initially, every card is available once).

A key statement from the puzzle description for the algorithm to work is "Cards will never make you copy a card past the end of the table."

=== Tests

Nothing special here.
