== Rust | Day 9: Mirage Maintenance

=== Input

Lines of lists into `Vec<Vec<...>>`:

=== Star 1

I wanted to avoid to allocate a new vector in every iteration step, so I do the processing in place. This results in a `successors` iterator with side effects on the mutable `values` vector. Maybe a while loop would be cleaner in that case, but I had to give in to my iterator fetish.

The tail values of all iterations equally contribute to the prediction in a simple sum.

=== Star 2

I was expecting much more complicated. It took a short moment to get the signs right, but essentially, just a duplication of part 1.

The head values of all iterations contribute to the prediction through an alternating sum. The head of the original data contributes positively.

(Alternatively, it is possible to revert the whole list or pseudo-revert it by changing some signs. The main advantage is to avoid code duplication, I guess. I could not measure a significant difference in performance.)
