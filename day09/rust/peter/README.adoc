=== Input

Lines of lists into `Vec<Vec<...>>`:

=== Star 1

I wanted to avoid to allocate a new vector in every iteration step, so I do the processing in place. This results in a `successors` iterator with side effects on the mutable `values` vector. Maybe a while loop would be cleaner in that case, but I had to give in to my iterator fetish.

The tail values of all iterations equally contribute to the prediction in a simple sum.

=== Star 2

I was expecting much more complicated. It took a short moment to get the signs right, but essentially, just a duplication of part 1.

The head values of all iterations contribute to the prediction through an alternating sum. The head of the original data contributes positively.
