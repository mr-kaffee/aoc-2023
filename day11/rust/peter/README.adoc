== Rust | Day 11: Cosmic Expansion

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11[AoC|2023|11].

=== Input

I store the coordinates of each galaxy in a vector and create two more vectors with the galaxy counts in every column/row.

=== Star 1

The basic approach was kind of straight forward. I experimented a bit with possibilities for optimization ending up with computing vectors with the offsets for each column and row that are indexed by the original positions of the galaxies (before expansion of the universe), to calculate the shortest distances in a single pass through all (unordered) pairs of galaxies.

I also experimented a bit with `flat_map` vs `map` for the nested iterators. In theory, `iter_a.flat_map(|a| iter_b.map(move |b| calc_val(a, b))).sum()` should create a bit of overhead compared to `iter_a.map(|a| iter_b.map(|b| calc_val(a, b)).sum()).sum()`. In practice, the differences were hardly in the range of fluctuations of the overall solution time.

=== Star 2

Even in my very first version, I did not alter the grid at all but just adjusted coordinates. So the second part was mostly for free (the only catch was to realize that I need to multiply by one million, not add one million).
